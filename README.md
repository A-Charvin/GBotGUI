Game Bot with a Graphical User Interface
=======

The Game Bot with a Graphical User Interface (or simply GBotGUI) is a bot for online graphical MMOs that doesn't depend on AutoHotKey. Comes complete with its own set of tools and GUI for easy use.

It's actually pretty badass... and fully open source ([Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)). I've seen people pay money for less.

Not made for any specific game. My account name (Xunnamius) and all related information are mine alone, and anyone else on the net bearing the same account name or information is by pure coincidence alone, as we are probably not the same person. Don't try to be a hero, it doesn't suit you.

Expansions coming soon. Report any bugs, ideas, or concerns to the [issues page](https://github.com/Xunnamius/GBotGUI/issues).

Enjoy :P
