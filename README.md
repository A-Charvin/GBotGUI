GBotGUI
=======

A bot for online graphical MMOs that doesn't depend on AutoHotKey! Comes complete with its own set of tools and GUI for easy use.

It's actually pretty badass (OO, extensible, maintainable). I've seen people pay money for less.

Check it out :P

Not made for any specific game. My account name (Xunnamius) and all related information are mine alone, and anyone else on the net bearing the same account name or information is by pure coincidence, as we are probably not the same person. Don't try to be a hero.

Please report any bugs you find to the Issues page.
