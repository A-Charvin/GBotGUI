Game Bot with a Graphical User Interface
=======

The Game Bot with a Graphical User Interface (or simply GBotGUI) is a bot for online graphical MMOs. Comes complete with its own set of tools and GUI for easy use.

It's actually pretty badass... and fully open source ([Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)). I've seen people pay money for less.

Expansions coming soon. Report any bugs, ideas, or concerns to the [issues page](https://github.com/Xunnamius/GBotGUI/issues).

Enjoy :P
